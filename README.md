# Welcome to PocketDiner
**  **

Never get screwed at lunch again. PocketDiner is not just a mere tip calculator - it's designed to be the do-everything toolkit for those who eat out in an office setting. No one counts dollars and cents when eating with friends, but face it - your coworkers are deadbeats. If you've been to a twenty five person birthday lunch with the folks at work and ended up forty-seven dollars short when the bill came, you'll know what we're talking about. This app is for you, when just dividing by the number people is too simple.

PocketDiner Features:
- Keep track of what everyone orders and what is shared.
- Split the bill and make everyone pay for what they ordered.
- Birthday mode lets you designate who eats free and fairly divides their order amongst everyone else. 
- Adjustable tax and tip rates.
- Share food with one person in the group or with everyone in the group and split the cost only for those who need to pay.
- Meal and diner bill totals are easily accessible with a simple swipe up
- Add diners either from your contacts or manually.
